## JWI Highlight Tool ##

	The highlight tool is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to assist with you with searching for multiple keywords in multiple PDF documents.
	
## Before you use ##

	Ensure that you have a excel file with a list of the keywords you would like to search all in column 1 with the first term in row 3. The terms are not case sensitive and do not need to be capitalized.
	
## Instructions ##

	Open the HighlightTool.exe file. It will bring up the GUI. You will see two options, a button and a checkbox. 
	
	The checkbox allows you to select what type of output you would like the program to save. Keeping the box checked saves selected output, creating files where only pages that have a code from the excel sheet on them are saved. Unchecking the box saves the entire PDF with highlights, not removing any pages. 
	
	The Highlight PDFs button allows you to run the program. The program will bring up a window allowing you to select PDFs. Once you have selected as many PDFs as you would like, press "Open." Next the program will direct you to select and excel file where you have listed your keywords. Once you have selected the excel file press "Open." 
	
	The program will now highlight and save highlighted files in a folder named "Highlighted_Outputs." On the GUI, progress updates will periodically display. Additionally, if any keywords were not found in each PDF, the program will display that info. Upon completion the program will give you the option to open the output folder. 

## Additional Notes ##

	The program will automatically open to search for PDFs and the excel file wherever the program is currently located, copying and pasting the file to the location of your PDFs may be helpful. 
	
	If you have made a mistake with selection you may click out of the PDF or excel selection and start over by pressing the highlight PDFs button again.
